# Agent Retry Logic Implementation

## Overview

The Balsan AI Agent (Laila Al-Noor) now includes intelligent retry logic that allows the agent to attempt up to **20 times** to solve a user's problem using various tools and approaches.

## Key Features

### 1. **Attempt Tracking**

- Each conversation maintains an `attempt_count` that increments with each tool usage
- Maximum attempts set to 20 per conversation
- Attempt information is displayed in tool execution results

### 2. **Enhanced ReAct Pattern**

The agent follows an enhanced ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern:

- **Thought:** Analyzes what went wrong and considers alternative approaches
- **Action:** Tries different tools, parameters, or strategies
- **Observation:** Reflects on results and decides next steps
- **Final Answer:** Provides solution or explanation of attempts made

### 3. **Intelligent Retry Strategies**

When a tool fails or doesn't provide expected results, the agent:

- Analyzes what went wrong
- Tries different parameter combinations
- Uses alternative tools (e.g., `get_common_accounts` before `get_account_balance`)
- Adjusts search criteria or approaches
- Provides helpful error context and suggestions

### 4. **State Management**

- Custom `AgentState` extends `MessagesState` with attempt tracking
- Preserves attempt count across conversation turns
- Maintains conversation context while enabling persistence

## Implementation Details

### Modified Components

#### 1. **AgentState Class**

```python
class AgentState(MessagesState):
    """Extended state with attempt tracking for retry logic."""
    attempt_count: int = 0
    max_attempts: int = 20
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Agent Node**

- Tracks attempt count and provides context to the agent
- Informs agent of current attempt number and remaining tries
- Encourages different approaches on subsequent attempts

#### 3. **Smart Router Logic**

- Continues conversation if agent is still thinking (`thought:` without `final answer:`)
- Allows tool usage when agent indicates need for more information
- Stops after maximum attempts or when final answer is provided

#### 4. **Enhanced Tool Node**

- Shows attempt number in tool execution results
- Provides retry suggestions on failures
- Maintains state consistency across tool calls

### Usage Examples

#### Simple Query (1 attempt)

```
User: "What's the cash balance for BLS company?"
Agent uses get_account_balance successfully on first try
```

#### Complex Query (Multiple attempts)

```
User: "Find the account named 'Sales Revenue' and show me its balance"
Attempt 1: get_common_accounts (to find account names)
Attempt 2: get_account_balance with "Sales" parameter
Result: Successfully finds and reports sales revenue balance
```

#### Error Recovery

```
Attempt 1: get_account_balance("invalid_account") → Fails
Attempt 2: get_common_accounts() → Success, gets valid account list
Attempt 3: get_account_balance("11101") → Success with correct account
```

## Configuration

### Default Settings

- **Max Attempts:** 20 per conversation
- **Retry Strategy:** Intelligent ReAct-based reasoning
- **State Persistence:** Maintained across conversation turns

### Customization

The retry behavior can be adjusted by modifying:

- `max_attempts` in `AgentState` class
- Retry logic in `should_continue()` router function
- Tool error handling in `create_tool_node()`

## Benefits

1. **Improved Success Rate:** Agent doesn't give up after first failure
2. **Better User Experience:** More likely to find solutions to complex queries
3. **Intelligent Problem Solving:** Uses reasoning to try different approaches
4. **Transparent Process:** Users can see attempt progress and reasoning
5. **Robust Error Handling:** Graceful handling of tool failures and edge cases

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:

- Simple queries (successful on first attempt)
- Complex queries requiring multiple tools
- Error scenarios with tool failures
- Edge cases with invalid parameters

Both test scripts (`test_retry_logic.py` and `test_retry_complex.py`) demonstrate the functionality working correctly with proper attempt tracking and ReAct pattern execution.
