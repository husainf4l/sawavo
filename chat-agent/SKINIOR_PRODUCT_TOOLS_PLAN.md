# Skinior Product Tools Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the planned implementation of product tools for the Skinior AI agent to provide personalized skincare recommendations based on Skinior's AI analysis capabilities.

## Current State
- ✅ Agent successfully converted from Al Balsan financial advisor to Skinior skincare consultant
- ✅ Financial tools removed (financial_tools.py, python_analysis_tool.py)
- ✅ System prompting updated for skincare consultation
- ✅ Research tools retained (Google Search, News, Business Research)
- ✅ Communication tools retained (Email functionality)
